# React Employee Directory

## Description
    
This employee directory application was written using React. Utilizing the React state, employers can search their employees by name, number, email or username. The application can also sort by the same categories. With React, this single page application makes searching and sorting employees a seamless and smooth experience by quickly rendering only what is needed.
